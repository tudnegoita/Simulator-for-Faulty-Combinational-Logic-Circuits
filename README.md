A program that simulates a Combinational Logic Circuit that is described in a text file with a predetermined syntax that
gives the user the posibility to generate the truth table, the truth table with a fault in the circuit, to insert stuck-at faults
for certain inputs to determine whether the fault is detectable or not and also to generate a set of test vectors that can
detect all possible faults.
